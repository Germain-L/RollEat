# RollEat | What is it ?
RollEat is an EPSI Bordeaux open innov project.

## What does it do ?
RollEat is an service where the user orders food, however the food is selected at random from a given criteria.

The criteria is as such:
 - A given budget (maximum price).
 - How many servings.
 - A health level of the dish (i imagine it as a slider with fastfood on one side and salads on the other).
 - Any allergies.
 - Any food that is disliked.


RollEat will also be able to somehow find out how a restaurant is doing, and if required skew the randomness towards a meal from that restaurant. In a way it will help local businesses.

The app could also ask the user to rate the received food and over time create second option to get surprised by receiving something they have already liked.
